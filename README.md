Because this portion of the code primarily consists of UI, testing the application was done manually. This is also due in part to the dependency of needing to test on multiple phones at a time and coordinating the timing. 

Due to setup requirements to meet google maps api compatibility, the application most likely will not be able to run after a fresh clone of the code, but since the specifications says this portion is optional, we plan to demo the code at the next meeting
